Mercur is an open-core **marketplace platform** built on top of the [Medusa Framework](https://medusajs.com). It follows a block-based architecture — install only the modules, workflows, API routes, and UI extensions you need directly into your project. No black-box dependencies, full code ownership.

## What is Mercur

Medusa provides the underlying commerce engine — products, pricing, carts, orders, fulfillment, and events — while Mercur builds the marketplace domain layer on top of it.

On top of Medusa's core, Mercur introduces marketplace entities and workflows such as sellers, onboarding, product requests, commissions, reviews, return escalations, order splitting, vendor payouts, and dedicated Admin, Vendor, and Storefront APIs.

It comes with three optional interfaces:

- an **Admin Panel** for marketplace operators
- a **Vendor Portal** for seller teams
- a **Storefront** ready for marketplace scenarios

## Why Mercur

### Built on a modern stack

Mercur runs on a modern TypeScript backend powered by the Medusa framework, giving you a proven foundation for products, carts, orders, promotions, and payments. It integrates with technologies like Resend (notifications), Algolia (search), and Stripe Connect (payouts) — all replaceable when needed.

### Block-based architecture

Unlike traditional plugins, Mercur uses a **block-based** approach. Blocks are copied directly into your project via the CLI, giving you full ownership and the ability to modify any piece of code without forking.

### Full extensibility and ownership

Mercur is fully open-core and MIT-licensed. There are no transaction fees, no commercial lock-in, and no constraints on how your marketplace must behave. You own the entire codebase and can host it anywhere.
