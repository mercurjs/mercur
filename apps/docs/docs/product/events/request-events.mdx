## Notes

### Dynamic Event Pattern

The Requests Module uses a dynamic event naming pattern for status updates: `requests.{type}.{status}`. This means that when a request's status changes, an event is emitted with a name that includes both the request type and the new status.

**Request Types:**
- `product` - Product creation requests
- `product_update` - Product update requests
- `product_category` - Product category creation requests
- `product_collection` - Product collection creation requests
- `product_type` - Product type creation requests
- `product_tag` - Product tag creation requests
- `seller` - Seller account creation requests
- `review_remove` - Review removal requests

**Status Values:**
- `accepted` - Request has been approved
- `rejected` - Request has been denied
- `pending` - Request is awaiting review
- `draft` - Request is in draft status

This allows subscribers to listen to specific combinations, such as:
- `requests.product.accepted` - When a product request is accepted
- `requests.seller.rejected` - When a seller registration is rejected
- Or use wildcard patterns to handle multiple events
