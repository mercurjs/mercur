## Notes

### Event Usage

The `algolia.reviews.changed` event is primarily used for search index synchronization. When emitted, subscribers can:

1. **Update Search Indexes**: Keep Algolia search indexes synchronized with the latest review data
2. **Recalculate Ratings**: Trigger recalculation of aggregate ratings for products or sellers
3. **Send Notifications**: Notify relevant parties (sellers, admins) about new or updated reviews
4. **Analytics**: Track review activity for analytics and reporting purposes

### Review Deletion

Note that the `deleteReviewWorkflow` does **not** emit any events. Review deletions are handled through workflow hooks rather than events. If you need to react to review deletions, use the workflow's `reviewDeleted` hook or subscribe to the `requests.review.removed` event from the Requests Module, which triggers the deletion workflow.

### Review References

Reviews can be associated with two types of entities:

- **Products** (`reference: "product"`) - Customer reviews of products they purchased
- **Sellers** (`reference: "seller"`) - Customer reviews of their experience with sellers

The event payload includes the full review object, allowing subscribers to determine which type of entity was reviewed and take appropriate actions.
