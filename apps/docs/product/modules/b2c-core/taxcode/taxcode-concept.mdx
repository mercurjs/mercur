# Tax Code Module

In this section of the documentation, you will find resources to learn more about the Tax Code Module and how to use it in your application.

Mercur has tax code management features available out-of-the-box through the Tax Code Module. A [module](https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/modules) is a standalone package that provides features for a single domain. Each of Mercur's marketplace features are placed in custom modules, such as this Tax Code Module.

Learn more about why modules are isolated in [this documentation](https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/modules/isolation).

## Tax Code Features

- **Tax Code Storage**: Store standardized tax classification codes for products and categories.
- **Stripe Integration**: Fetch and sync tax codes from Stripe's Tax Code API.
- **Category Association**: Link tax codes to product categories for automatic tax classification.
- **Tax Compliance**: Enable proper tax calculation based on product type and jurisdiction.

## How to Use the Tax Code Module

The Tax Code Module provides a service method to sync tax codes from Stripe:

```ts
import { TAXCODE_MODULE } from "./modules/taxcode"

// In a workflow or API route
const taxCodeService = container.resolve(TAXCODE_MODULE)

// Fetch all available tax codes from Stripe
const stripeTaxCodes = await taxCodeService.getTaxCodes()

// Create tax code records in the database
const taxCodes = await taxCodeService.createTaxCodes(
  stripeTaxCodes.map(code => ({
    code: code.id,
    name: code.name,
    description: code.description,
  }))
)
```

# Concepts

In this document, you'll learn about the main concepts related to tax codes in Mercur.

## Tax Code

A tax code is a standardized classification code used for tax calculation and compliance. It is represented by the [TaxCode data model](../data-model/taxcode-module-data-reference#taxcode).

A tax code holds information about:

- A unique code identifier (e.g., `txcd_00000000` for general goods)
- A human-readable name
- A description explaining what products fall under this code
- Created and updated timestamps

Tax codes follow standardized formats like:
- Stripe tax codes
- HS (Harmonized System) codes for customs
- Product tax categories for sales tax

---

## Stripe Tax Code Integration

The Tax Code Module includes integration with Stripe's tax code system through the `getTaxCodes()` method.

### How It Works

1. Module connects to Stripe API using configured API key
2. Fetches tax codes in batches of 100 (Stripe's limit)
3. Automatically paginates through all available tax codes
4. Returns complete array of Stripe tax code objects

```ts
// Example Stripe tax codes:
// txcd_00000000 - General - Tangible Goods
// txcd_20010000 - Clothing
// txcd_10000000 - Books
// txcd_99999999 - Electronically supplied services
```

This allows marketplaces to maintain a synchronized catalog of valid tax codes without manual entry.

## Category-Level Tax Classification

Tax codes can be associated with product categories through module links:

**ProductCategory → TaxCode** (many-to-one)

This enables:
- Automatic tax classification for products in a category
- Consistent tax handling across similar products
- Simplified tax configuration (set once per category vs per product)

For example:
- "Electronics" category → `txcd_10200000` (Electronic equipment)
- "Clothing" category → `txcd_20010000` (Clothing)
- "Books" category → `txcd_10000000` (Books)

## Tax Code vs Tax Rate

It's important to distinguish between tax codes and tax rates:

**Tax Code** (This module):
- Classification code for product type
- Determines which tax rules apply
- Managed in Tax Code Module
- Example: "txcd_20010000" (Clothing)

**Tax Rate** (Medusa Tax Module):
- Percentage amount to charge
- Varies by jurisdiction
- Managed in Tax Module
- Example: 8.5% sales tax for California

Tax codes help tax systems determine **which** rate to apply, while tax rates determine **how much** tax to charge.

## Use Cases

**1. Stripe Tax Integration**
Sync marketplace with Stripe's complete tax code catalog for accurate tax calculation with Stripe Tax.

**2. Product Tax Classification**
Assign appropriate tax codes to product categories, ensuring all products are classified correctly for tax purposes.

**3. International Commerce**
Use HS codes for customs declarations and international shipping requirements.

**4. Tax Compliance**
Maintain proper tax records for audit purposes by classifying all products with standardized codes.

**5. Multi-Jurisdiction Support**
Different jurisdictions may tax product categories differently (e.g., clothing is tax-exempt in some states); tax codes help systems apply the right rules.
