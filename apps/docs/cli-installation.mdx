  .
</Info>

Follow these steps to install and run all Mercur components on your operating system:

**Step 1**: Install `mercur-cli` using NPM:

```bash
npm i -g mercur-cli
```

**Step 2**: Run CLI installation:

```bash
mercur-cli install
```

or

```bash
npx mercur-cli install
```

The script will guide you through the installation process. You will have to enter project name and database connection parameters. Also, you'll be asked if you want to install Mercur Storefront and Vendor panel.

**Step 3**: After installation is done, move to the project catalog and start the servers:

```bash
cd <yourProjectName>

mercur-cli dev
```

The script automatically configures environment variables, and runs seed. The default credentials for created users are:

**Vendor:**

```
email: seller@mercurjs.com
password: secret
```

**Admin:**

```
email: admin@mercurjs.com
password: admin
```
