# Seller

In Mercur, the `Seller` is the entity that represents member group in the marketplace.
You can think of a seller as a group of members that share the same products, orders etc.

Seller can be in state `ACTIVE`, which allows him to use the platform, or in state `SUSPENDED`, which prevents him from using the platform, except order and fulfillment management.

By default, a seller is linked to Medusa's default entities such as:

- `Product`
- `Order`
- `Return`
- `Stock Location`
- `Service Zone`
- `Shipping Option`
- `Shipping Profile`
- `Fulfillment Set`
- `Promotion`
- `Campaign`
- `Price List`
- `Customer Group`
- `Inventory Item`
