# LLM

Mercur’s documentation is optimized to be easily indexed and understood by Large Language Models (LLMs).\
\
This helps AI tools answer technical questions about Mercur more accurately by giving them a clear map of the documentation structure.

LLM indexing works similarly to how a sitemap helps search engines: AI tools read a structured file describing your docs and use it to locate relevant content quickly.

## llms.txt

The `llms.txt` file is an industry standard (see [llmstxt.org](https://llmstxt.org)) designed to help LLMs:

- understand the structure of your documentation
- discover all available pages
- resolve links and relationships between topics
- retrieve page descriptions
- provide more precise answers to developers

Your documentation site automatically includes an `llms.txt` file at the root of the project.\
It stays up to date with your docs structure and requires no maintenance.

To view it, append `/llms.txt` to your documentation URL:

https://docs.mercurjs.com/llms.txt

## llms-full.txt

The `llms-full.txt` file contains the _entire contents_ of your documentation in a single file.\
LLMs can use it to analyze the full context of your docs when providing answers, explanations, or troubleshooting steps.

You can view it at:
