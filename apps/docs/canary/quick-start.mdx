## Create a new project

```bash
npx @mercurjs/cli@canary create my-marketplace
```

The CLI will guide you through template selection, database configuration, and dependency installation.

## Add blocks

Browse and install blocks — the building units of your marketplace:

```bash
# Search available blocks
npx @mercurjs/cli@canary search

# Add blocks to your project
npx @mercurjs/cli@canary add reviews commission requests
```

## Start developing

```bash
cd my-marketplace
yarn dev
```

Your marketplace backend will be running at `http://localhost:9000`.
