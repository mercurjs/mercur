## Block-based architecture

Mercur 2.0 replaces monolithic plugin packages with **blocks** — individual pieces of code installed directly into your project via the CLI, similar to shadcn/ui.

| | 1.x | 2.0 |
|---|---|---|
| **Installation** | npm packages | CLI-installed blocks |
| **Code ownership** | node_modules | Your source tree |
| **Customization** | Override/extend | Edit directly |
| **Updates** | Package upgrades | `mercurjs diff` to review changes |

## CLI-first workflow

The new `@mercurjs/cli` provides commands for every step of the development lifecycle:

- `mercurjs create` — scaffold a new project
- `mercurjs add` — install blocks from the registry
- `mercurjs diff` — compare local changes against upstream
- `mercurjs search` — discover available blocks
- `mercurjs codegen` — generate TypeScript types from API routes

## New block types

In addition to modules and workflows, 2.0 introduces:

- **Links** — define relationships between modules
- **Admin Extensions** — customize the admin dashboard
- **Vendor Extensions** — customize the vendor portal

## Migration from 1.x

If you're upgrading from 1.x, start a fresh 2.0 project and selectively add the blocks you need. The underlying Medusa framework and data models remain compatible.
