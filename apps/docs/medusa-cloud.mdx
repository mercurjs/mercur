### Introduction

Medusa Cloud is a dedicated hosting service for Medusa-based applications. It automatically detects changes on your repository, pulls and builds the code, sets up a database, Redis and file storage.

In order to start using Medusa Cloud, head to the <a href="https://cloud.medusajs.com/signup">Medusa Cloud signup page</a>. After registration is complete and your account is active, you should authorize the Medusa Cloud Github app in your organization/account.

<Info>Medusa Cloud hosts only backend and admin panel.</Info>

### Setup

1. On the main dashboard view, click "Create project" button.
2. Thanks to the Github integration, Medusa Cloud can access your codebase and automatically pull the code. Choose your Mercur repository from the list and click "Continue".

5. Last configuration step is about environment variables. Remember, Medusa Cloud automatically sets up a database, Redis and file storage, so you don't have to worry about them.

Only the following variables should be set:

RESEND_API_KEY=
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=

ALGOLIA_APP_ID=

VITE_TALK_JS_SECRET_API_KEY=

STORE_CORS=
ADMIN_CORS=
VENDOR_CORS=

VENDOR_PANEL_URL=
STOREFRONT_URL=
BACKEND_URL=
```

6. After completing those steps, click "Create". The build and deploy process will start, and it can take a few minutes to complete.

Later, you can change those variables in environment settings, as well as change the deployment branch. Medusa Cloud will automatically pull and rebuild your environment if a new commit is pushed on this branch.
