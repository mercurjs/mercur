## Getting started üöÄ

Create a new Mercur project with the command:

```bash
npx mercurjs marketplace
```

You will be asked to enter the project's name and select the project‚Äôs modules (admin / vendor / storefront) platform you wish to use. Once selected, the CLI will create project files in the directory matching your project name.

## How to configure

#### API Configuration

**Initial Setup**

1. Navigate to the `/api` directory.
2. Execute the `yarn` command to install dependencies.
3. Build the admin and vendor ui:s; `yarn run build:admin && yarn run build:vendor`

**Environment Configuration**

1. Create a `.env` file in the root of the project.
2. Add the `DATABASE_URL` variable with your PostgreSQL database URL.

**Database and Server Initialization**

1. Seed the database:

```bash
yarn seed
```

2. Start the Medusa development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

The server will start on http://localhost:9000.

#### Admin panel

1. Navigate to the `/api` folder.
2. Run the `yarn dev` command to start API and admin panel in development mode
3. Log into the admin panel using the credentials created during the seeding process (admin@medusa-test.com with password supersecret).

#### Vendor panel

1. Navigate to the `/api` folder.
2. Run the `yarn dev:vendor` command to start vendor panel in development mode
3. Register vendor by accessing `vendor_url/register` page
4. Approve registered vendor on `Users` page in admin panel
5. Log in using vendor credentials
6. Now you can edit your vendor panel using `/vendor` folder in `src` directory [(See medusa admin quickstart)](https://docs.medusajs.com/admin/quickstart)

#### Storefront Setup

1. Navigate to the `/store-front` folder.
2. Run the `yarn` command to install dependencies.
3. Create an `.env` file in the root of the project folder with the following entries:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_MEDUSA_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:9000
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEFAULT_REGION=eu
REVALIDATE_SECRET=supersecret
```

4. Start the storefront application:

```bash
yarn dev
```

This will launch the storefront, typically available at http://localhost:8000.

#### Adding a Vendor User

To add a vendor user via the API, follow these steps:

1. Make a POST request to the endpoint `api_url/vendor/users` with the body:

```json
{
  "email": "vendoremail@email.com",
  "password": "vendorpassword"
}
```

Replace api_url with your actual API endpoint URL, typically something like http://localhost:9000.

This will create a new vendor user in the system. Before the vendor can log in, the admin must authorize his registration in the administration panel by making his status active.
