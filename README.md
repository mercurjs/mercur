# What is Mercur?

Mercur is the first JavaScript open-source platform for building multi-vendor marketplaces. Built on top of Medusa.js, it simplifies the development of customized marketplaces.

## Why Mercur?

After seeing the rising trend in multi-vendor business models and setting up several marketplaces from scratch at Rigby, we wanted to eliminate the repetitive setup of marketplaces.

The aim is to enable users to start a new marketplace in about five minutes, providing a strong starting point for anyone looking to build their own multi-vendor platform.

Medusa is an amazing and strong foundation for building marketplaces but requires a few modifications to adjust to this business model. We wanted a faster way to get these platforms up and running ‚Äî Mercur is that accelerator for building multi-vendor marketplace with Medusa.js as a core.

## Goals

We aim to make Mercur adaptable for various marketplace types, such as rental or service marketplaces.

We also want to build an ecosystem of plugins tailored to multi-vendor setups, including solutions for payment distributions like Stripe. We want to publish all plugins adapted to the multi-vendor market under the name `medusa-mercur-...` e.g. `medusa-mercur-stripe`. With this annotation, developers will always know that this is a plugin for the MVM.

Feel free to share your ideas on Medusa Discord, how you imagine the development of this project.

## Project Components:

![Mercur Architecture](https://rigby-web.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com/mercur-mvm-lgg.png)

- **Core:** The backbone of Mercur, handling the primary operations and data flow essential for marketplace functionality.
- **Admin:** Provides a control panel for marketplace administrators to manage vendors, orders, settings, and more.
- **Vendor:** A dedicated interface for vendors to manage their products, orders, and profile details.
- **Storefront:** The frontend where customers browse products, place orders, and interact with the marketplace. It is a customized version of the Medusa.js Next.js Starter.

## Project Features:

- **Vendor Registration:** Allows new vendors to sign up and await approval from marketplace administrators.
- **Vendor Profiles:** Enables vendors to create and customize their profiles on the marketplace.
- **Vendor Authorization by Admin:** Admins can review and authorize vendor registrations to maintain marketplace standards.
- **Order Splitting:** Facilitates the distribution of orders among multiple vendors involved in a single transaction.
- **Vendor Shipping Management:** Vendors can manage their shipping logistics independently within the platform.

## Roadmap:

- Payment provider & Commission Management & Invoices
- Adjustments to Medusa 2.0!
- More: coming soon

## Getting started üöÄ

Create a new Mercur project with the command:

```bash
npx mercurjs marketplace
```

You will be asked to enter the project's name and select the project‚Äôs modules (admin / vendor / storefront) platform you wish to use. Once selected, the CLI will create project files in the directory matching your project name.

## How to configure

#### API Configuration

**Initial Setup**

1. Navigate to the `/api` directory.
2. Execute the `yarn` command to install dependencies.
3. Build the admin and vendor ui:s; `yarn run build:admin && yarn run build:vendor`

**Environment Configuration**

1. Create a `.env` file in the root of the project.
2. Add the `DATABASE_URL` variable with your PostgreSQL database URL.

**Database and Server Initialization**

1. Seed the database:

```bash
yarn seed
```

2. Start the Medusa development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

The server will start on http://localhost:9000.

#### Admin panel

1. Navigate to the `/api` folder.
2. Run the `yarn dev` command to start API and admin panel in development mode
3. Log into the admin panel using the credentials created during the seeding process (admin@medusa-test.com with password supersecret).

#### Vendor panel

1. Navigate to the `/api` folder.
2. Run the `yarn dev:vendor` command to start vendor panel in development mode
3. Register vendor by accessing `vendor_url/register` page
4. Approve registered vendor on `Users` page in admin panel
5. Log in using vendor credentials
6. Now you can edit your vendor panel using `/vendor` folder in `src` directory [(See medusa admin quickstart)](https://docs.medusajs.com/admin/quickstart)

#### Storefront Setup

1. Navigate to the `/store-front` folder.
2. Run the `yarn` command to install dependencies.
3. Create an `.env` file in the root of the project folder with the following entries:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_MEDUSA_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:9000
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEFAULT_REGION=eu
REVALIDATE_SECRET=supersecret
```

4. Start the storefront application:

```bash
yarn dev
```

This will launch the storefront, typically available at http://localhost:8000.

#### Adding a Vendor User

To add a vendor user via the API, follow these steps:

1. Make a POST request to the endpoint `api_url/vendor/users` with the body:

```json
{
  "email": "vendoremail@email.com",
  "password": "vendorpassword"
}
```

Replace api_url with your actual API endpoint URL, typically something like http://localhost:9000.

This will create a new vendor user in the system. Before the vendor can log in, the admin must authorize his registration in the administration panel by making his status active.
